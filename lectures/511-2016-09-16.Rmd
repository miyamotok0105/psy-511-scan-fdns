## Today's Topics

- The action potential
- Synaptic communication

## Party On

- Annie (A-) was having a party.
    + Used to date Nate (Na+), but now sees Karl (K+)
- Hired bouncers called
    + "The Channels"
    + Let Karl and friends in or out, keep Nate out
- Annie's friends (A-) and Karl's (K+) mostly inside
- Nate and friends (Na+) mostly outside
- Claudia (Cl-) tagging along

## Summary of forces

| Ion | Concentration gradient | Electrostatic force |
|-----|------------------------|---------------------|
| K+  | Inside >> Outside, outward      | - (pulls K+ in)    |
| Na+ | Outside >> Inside, inward      | - (pulls Na+ in)    |

## What's a [Na+/K+ pump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Na%2B/K%2B-ATPase)?

- Enzyme (*Na+/K+ ATP-ase*) embedded in neuron membrane
- Pumps Na+ and K+ *against* concentration gradients
- Na+ out; K+ in
- Uses [ATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate) or chemical energy

## Na+/K+ "pump" keeps K+ and Na+ separated

## Action potential

- Rapid rise, fall of membrane potential
- Threshold of excitation
- Increase (rising phase/depolarization)
- Peak
    + at positive voltage
- Decline (falling phase/repolarization)
- Return to resting potential (refractory period)

## Action potential components

| Phase             | Neuron State |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Rise to threshold | + input makes membrane potential more + |
| Rising phase      | Voltage-gated Na+ channels open, Na+ enters |
| Peak              | Voltage-gated Na+ channels close and deactivate; voltage-gated K+ channels open |
| Falling phase     | K+ exits |
| Refractory period | Na+/K+ pump restores [Na+], [K+]; voltage-gated K+ channels close |

## Question

- During rising phase, Na+ enters because
    + Force of diffusion pushes Na+ in
    + Electrostatic force pushes Na+ in
    + Electrostatic force pushes K+ out

## Question

- During rising phase, Na+ enters because
    + **Force of diffusion pushes Na+ in**
    + **Electrostatic force pushes Na+ in**
    + Electrostatic force pushes K+ out
   
## Question

- Why does membrane potential go from - to +?
    + Na+ ions are +, inward flow makes interior more +
    + K+ ions are +, outward flow makes interior more +

## Question

- At peak of action potential, why does electrostatic force push K+ out?
    + Membane potential is +, K+ repelled from interior
    + Membrane potential is -, K- attracted to interior

    + Membrane potential is -, K- attracted to interior
    
## Refractory periods

- *Absolute refractory period*
    + Cannot generate action potential (AP) no matter the size of the stimulus
    + Voltage-gated Na+ channels inactivated, reactivate in time.
- *Relative refractory period*
    + Can generate AP with larg(er) stimulus
    + Some voltage-gated K+ channels still open
- Refractory periods put 'spaces' between APs

## Information processing

- AP amplitudes don't vary (much)
    + All or none

## Generating APs

- *Axon hillock*
    + Portion of soma adjacent to axon
    + Integrates/sums input to soma
- *Axon initial segment*
    + Umyelinated portion of axon adjacent to soma
    + Voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels exposed
    + If sum of input to soma > threshold, voltage-gated Na+ channels open

## AP propagation

- Propagation
    + move down axon, away from soma, toward axon terminals.
- Unmyelinated axon
    + Each segment "excites" the next
    
## AP propagation is like

## AP propagation

- Myelinated axon
    + AP "jumps" between *Nodes of Ranvier*, *saltatory conduction*
    + Nodes of Ranvier == unmyelinated sections of axon
    + voltage-gated Na+, K+ channels exposed
    + Current flows through myelinated segments
    
## Question

- Why does AP flow in one direction, away from soma?
    + Soma does not have (many) voltage-gated Na+ channels.
    + Soma is not myelinated.
    + Refractory periods mean polarization only in one direction.

## What happens when AP runs out of axon?

- Rapid change in voltage triggers neurotransmitter (NT) release
- Voltage-gated calcium Ca++ channels open
- Ca++ causes *synaptic vesicles* to bind with presynaptic membrane, merge
- NTs diffuse across *synaptic cleft*
- NTs bind with *receptors* on *postsynaptic membrane*
- NTs unbind, are inactivated

## Synaptic transmission

- Electrical
- Chemical

## Receptor/channel types

- Leak/passive
    + Vary in selectivity, permeability
- Transporters/exchangers
    + Ionic
        * Na+/K+
    + Chemical
        * e.g., Dopamine transporter (DAT)

## Receptor/channel types

- Ionotropic receptors (receptor + ion channel)
    + Ligand-gated
    + Open/close channel
- Metabotropic receptors (receptor only)
    + Triggers 2nd messengers
    + G-proteins
    + Open/close adjacent channels, change metabolism

## Gap junctions

- *Cytosol* flows through adjacent neurons

## Receptor types

<div class="centered">
<img src="http://webvision.med.utah.edu/imageswv/GLU5.jpeg">
</div>

## Receptors generate *postsynaptic potentials (PSPs)*

- Small voltage changes
- Amplitude scales with # of receptors activated
- *Excitatory PSPs (EPSPs)*
    + Depolarize neuron (make more +)
- *Inhibitory (IPSPs)*
    + Hyperpolarize neuron (make more -)

## NTs inactivated

- Buffering
    + e.g., glutamate into astrocytes
- Reuptake via transporters
    + e.g., serotonin via serotonin transporter (SERT)
- Enzymatic degradation
    + e.g., AChE degrades ACh
    
## Questions to ponder

- Why must NTs be inactivated?
- What sort of PSP would the following induce:
    + Open Na+ channel
    + Open K+ channel
    + Open Cl- channel, [Cl-out]>>[Cl-in]
