## Meeting Location and Time

WF 2:30-3:45PM</br>

## Goals

The first scientific psychologists were physiologists fascinated by the possibility of understanding the mind by studying the brain. In this course, we will explore the historical roots and contemporary challenges associated with the study of biological approaches to complex adaptive behavior. In doing so, we will read and examine critically primary source readings that discuss basic patterns and processes of brain structure and function. The goal is to provide students with a basic foundation of knowledge about the structures and functions of the nervous system that can provide the basis for future study.

## Prerequisites

Undergraduate coursework in neuroscience or physiological psychology such as the equivalents of PSYCH 260 or BIO 469/470.

## Resources

### Textbook

Breedlove, S. M. & Watson, N. V. (2013). *Biological Psychology: An introduction to behavioral and cognitive neuroscience (7th ed.)*. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer.

## Policies

### Academic Integrity

It is your responsibility to maintain high standards of academic integrity. If you cheat on any assignment, copy the work of another student, or quote a published source without attribution, you may receive an F for the assignment or be subject to other penalties, as well. If you do not know what constitutes cheating or plagiarism, see the instructor.

### Late, missed or make-up assignments

#### Exams and Quizzes

Make-up exams and quizzes may be permitted under unusual circumstances such as (a) an interview for graduate school or a job, (b) illness, (c) religious observance, (d) the death of a family member, or (e) any other event recognized by the university as a valid excuse for absence from class. 

If you must miss class on the day an exam is scheduled, you must do the following:

1. Contact the the instructor by telephone, email, or in person in advance of the exam. Twenty-four hours notice is expected. If you do not contact the instructor in advance, it is possible that you may not be able to schedule a make-up exam.
2. Arrange with the instructor to take a make-up exam as soon as possible, but no later than one (1) week following the date of the scheduled exam. It is your responsibility, not the instructor's to schedule an approved make-up exam in a timely way.

#### Accommodation for persons with disabilities

The Pennsylvania State University encourages qualified persons with disabilities to participate in its programs and activities. If you anticipate needing any type of accommodation in this course or have questions about physical access, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.
